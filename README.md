# always work in progress

Every time I ask somebody about their dotfiles repo I hear something along the lines of "I've been planning to clean it up a bit"

Yes, I've also been planning to clean my dotfiles a bit... And I will get round to it eventually...
Oh and I just noticed that I already said that in the last line of this readme... smh

# other stuff

also included but probably not easily reusable:
`.cvimrc` (my settings for cvim addon for google chrome)
some scripts I use, gnome settings (not sure if reusable)
some install scripts for the 'other stuff'

// might clean this up more if I have time or some actual reason :D
